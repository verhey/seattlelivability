# Wait! Before you go any further...

This project is abandoned. This project was originally created for an undergraduate-level course at Western Washington University in 2017. 

I'm leaving it up for posterity, but after looking at it two years later, the following are things I don't like or would have done differently: 
* There's a lot of code duplication that would be relatively trivial to fix. Especially among the `viz_*` files. 
* Dynamically generated SQL statements instead of prepared statements. 
   * Yikes.
* Code formatting is overall bizarre. 
* There is minimal-to-no seperation of HTML, CSS, JS, SQL, and PHP.
* The Tableau vizzes and database running the site are essentially duplicated. 
  * It's the same data, but the site runs off a MySQL DB, Tableau vizzes run off flat files associated with the visualizations themselves. 

## Synopsis
Tool to display Tableau Visualizations on Seattle Open Data based on user input on neighborhoods.
 
End goal is to be able to select a desirable neighborhood in the city based on their own values and interests - traffic, bars, etc.

## Motivation

To create an accessible tool that helps users analyze Seattleâ€™s neighborhoods on various metrics. 

## Installation

* Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
 * If using something other than VirtualBox for virtualization, make sure you modify the Vagrantfile in the root of the repository to reflect that change. 
* `vagrant up` 

## Configuration

Create config.ini with database credentials
* See `includes/connection.php` for reference

## Notes
This is not intended to be production-level software, nor was it created as such. It was created for my own educational purposes.
